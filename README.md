# My Movie App

This is a project that I am still actively working on but works as a small standalone project to view popular movies and search movies from the TMDB API. I am currently backtracking 
to learn React and then will come back and rebuild this and improve all of the features with what I have learned from tutorials.

## Features
 - 3 main tabs called: Popular | Browse | Watchlist
 - Movie data taken from the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)
 - Popular page currently populated with the top 20 most popular films and is the landing page
 - Search functionality is working with search in the navbar so it can be performed from anywhere
 
 ## To Be Implemented
 - Watchlist functionality: being able to add any movie to your watchlist and then being able to view the watchlist in the tab
 - Detail view for any individual movie, currently there is only the title and poster being displayed but I want the user to be able to click and view more information about any film
 - Browse filters: being able to filter the movies by genre, director, rating etc.
